# Temp Email Server
This project was created to realize a platform to let businesses have a front filter for business emails that are usually bloated by various spam and menace types.
Many messages can be filtered using standard graylisting and bayesian filters, but quite often it happens that mail lists, for instance, are forged to bypass these filters.
Idea behind this tool is to let a business use its standard mailboxes on the main mail server, letting people generate custom additional aliases that can live even just 1 send and 1 receive and then be deleted.
Some more evolutions in roadmap for this product were the chance of creating a browser extension to let people use this feature from their favourite browser and other features.
As of now it can still be a valid tool to have a first line for all those mailboxes that are not served by Google, Microsoft and the other major webmail and workspace services.
